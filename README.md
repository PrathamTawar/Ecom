## eCommerce Site

# To see the products from the live site on github pages:-

1) clone the repo
2) install requirements
3) run server from backend
4) make sure to add your own database and your own secret key in settings.py OR make your own new settings if that doesnt work ```(havent tested that yet)```
5) make sure the server is running on ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/``` OR change the site inside every JS to your own site

# To checkout the page without cloning go to:- <a href="https://prathamtawar.github.io/Ecom/frontend/Home/home.html" target="_blank"><h3>24 Cart</h3></a>
